    <h3>Terminologi Git</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Repository</h4>
        <p>In general, a repository is a location containing stored information and data about users, people, computers, or other important information.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Branch</h4>
        <p>A branch represents an independent line of development. ... The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn't let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Clone</h4>
        <p>Git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Commit</h4>
        <p>The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Push </h4>
        <p>he git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h4>Pull</h4>
        <p>The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Merge</h4>
        <p>Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches. ... Once Git finds a common base commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes of each queued merge commit sequence.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h4>Working directory</h4>
        <p>The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. This essentially means if you checkout a branch (e.g. master) and are sat on a particular commit (e.g. HEAD), your working directory is the "umbrella" term for all your files and folders.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h4>Staging</h4>
        <p>To stage a file is simply to prepare it finely for a commit. Git, with its index allows you to commit only certain parts of the changes you've done since the last commit. Say you're working on two features – one is finished, and one still needs some work done.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h4>HEAD</h4>
        <p>The term HEAD refers to the current commit you are viewing. By default, you'll view the tip of the master branch on a repository, unless the main branch of your repository has a different name. The tip of the master branch is the most recent commit on the main branch of your codebase.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h4>Revert</h4>
        <p>The git revert command is used for undoing changes to a repository's commit history. Other 'undo' commands like, git checkout and git reset , move the HEAD and branch ref pointers to a specified commit. Git revert also takes a specified commit, however, git revert does not move ref pointers to this commit.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Reset</h4>
        <p>To review, git reset is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo. Git reset operates on "The Three Trees of Git". These trees are the Commit History ( HEAD ), the Staging Index, and the Working Directory. There are three command line options that correspond to the three trees.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Fork</h4>
        <p>Fork is when you make a copy of a repository with the purpose of giving the project your take on it. The difference from clone,
            is that with a fork the purpose is not to change the original repository, but to make a new project from it. Branch is different from 
            fork, because a branch is made from a repository, but a fork is an entire repository.
        </p>
