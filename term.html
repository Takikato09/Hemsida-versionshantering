    <h3>Terminologi Git</h3>

    <h4>Repository
        <p>In general, a repository is a location containing stored information and data about users, people, computers, or other important information.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>Branch
        <p>A branch represents an independent line of development. ... The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn't let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>Clone
        <p>Git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>Commit
        <p>The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>Push
        <p>he git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>Pull
        <p>The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>Merge
        <p>Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches. ... Once Git finds a common base commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes of each queued merge commit sequence.</p>
