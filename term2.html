    <h4>Working directory
        <p>The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. This essentially means if you checkout a branch (e.g. master) and are sat on a particular commit (e.g. HEAD), your working directory is the "umbrella" term for all your files and folders.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>Staging
        <p>To stage a file is simply to prepare it finely for a commit. Git, with its index allows you to commit only certain parts of the changes you've done since the last commit. Say you're working on two features – one is finished, and one still needs some work done.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>HEAD
        <p>The term HEAD refers to the current commit you are viewing. By default, you'll view the tip of the master branch on a repository, unless the main branch of your repository has a different name. The tip of the master branch is the most recent commit on the main branch of your codebase.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>Revert
        <p>The git revert command is used for undoing changes to a repository's commit history. Other 'undo' commands like, git checkout and git reset , move the HEAD and branch ref pointers to a specified commit. Git revert also takes a specified commit, however, git revert does not move ref pointers to this commit.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>Reset
        <p>To review, git reset is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo. Git reset operates on "The Three Trees of Git". These trees are the Commit History ( HEAD ), the Staging Index, and the Working Directory. There are three command line options that correspond to the three trees.</p>
